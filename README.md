# libraryManagementSystem

The LibraryClasses.Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage a small library's operations. It features an object-oriented design with classes for LibraryClasses.Book, LibraryClasses.User, and LibraryClasses.Library, each handling specific tasks like borrowing books, user registration, and book management. The system includes a text-based user interface and supports persistent data storage using file I/O. Additionally, unit testing is integrated to ensure the reliability of key methods. This project provides hands-on experience with OOP, data structures, file handling, and software testing.
