# libraryManagementSystem

The LibraryClasses.Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage a small library's operations. It features an object-oriented design with classes for LibraryClasses.Book, LibraryClasses.User, and LibraryClasses.Library, each handling tasks like borrowing books, user registration, and book management. The system includes a text-based user interface and supports data storage using file I/O. 

Additionally, unit testing is used to ensure the functionality of methods. This project helped my knowledge with OOP (Object Oriented Programming), data structures, file handling, and testing.
